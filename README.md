Simple benchmark for comparing different dataclass-like providers.

Adapted from https://github.com/mCodingLLC/VideosSampleCode/blob/master/videos/079_which_dataclass_is_best/dataclasses_comparison.py

But included comparisons to:
- msgspec
- SQLModel
- SQLAlchemy

Most SQLAlchemy related stuff unfortunately don't quite work.
